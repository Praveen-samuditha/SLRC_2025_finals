# PixieBots - SLRC 2025 Finalists

We're the PixieBots, and we're thrilled to share the culmination of our journey at **SLRC 2025 (Sri Lanka's Largest Robotic Competition)**, where we proudly secured a spot among the top five teams in the highly competitive University category! This repository showcases the engineering and software behind our robot, designed to tackle a complex, multi-faceted challenge under a demanding 30-minute time limit.

Our robot was engineered for precision and adaptability, demonstrating a wide array of autonomous capabilities crucial for success in dynamic environments. From delicate object manipulation to navigating treacherous terrain, our design pushed the boundaries of what's possible in robotic automation.

## The Robot: An Overview

Our robot boasts a compact and robust mechanical design, measuring approximately **24 cm in length and 18 cm in width**. Its core functionality revolves around a sophisticated **4-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robotic arm**. This arm isn't just for grasping; it's a versatile tool capable of:

* **Precise Object Manipulation:** Seamlessly picking up various objects, including delicate ping-pong balls and small boxes.
* **Color-Based Classification:** Accurately detecting and differentiating ping-pong balls by color, a critical aspect of the competition's sorting tasks.
* **Integrated Storage:** Efficiently storing two separately classified ping-pong balls within dedicated on-board compartments, ensuring organized collection during missions.

## Autonomous Capabilities

The intelligence behind our robot lies in its comprehensive set of autonomous navigation and sensing functionalities, allowing it to interpret and react to its surroundings with remarkable accuracy:

* **Line Following & Junction Detection:** Expertly tracking lines and identifying junctions, essential for navigating complex grid-based layouts.
* **Color Line Following:** Adapting its movement based on different colored lines, adding another layer of navigational complexity.
* **Dotted Line Following:** Demonstrating advanced line tracking capabilities by accurately following segmented or dotted lines.
* **Obstacle Detection:** Proactively identifying and avoiding obstacles, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted movement through challenging courses.

*(Suitable Image: A diagram or a photo illustrating the robot on a test track with lines and junctions, perhaps highlighting its sensors if visible.)*

* **Ramp Navigation & Speed Control:** Intelligently detecting ramps (like the 20-degree incline in the competition) and automatically adjusting its speed to ascend and descend safely and efficiently. This ensures stability and optimal performance on uneven terrain.

*(Suitable Image: A photo of your robot on a ramp, either ascending or descending, to visually represent this capability.)*

* **Barcode Reading (IR Sensor):** Utilizing an Infrared (IR) (IR) sensor for reliable barcode detection, enabling the robot to gather critical information from its environment.
* **Encoder PID for Straight-Line Navigation:** Employing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control system with encoders to maintain exceptional straight-line movement, minimizing error and ensuring precise positioning.

## Competition Journey

Our journey to the SLRC 2025 finals involved mastering a series of intricate tasks. The competition's ultimate challenge presented us with eight distinct objectives, all to be completed within a tight 30-minute window. Our robot excelled in:

1.  **Ping-Pong Ball Collection:** Grabbing ping-pong balls strategically placed on cylindrical components within a grid of squares.
2.  **Color-Based Ball Classification:** Differentiating and sorting balls by color, showcasing our arm's precision and sensor integration.
3.  **"Muddy Region" Navigation:** Maneuvering through a designated "muddy region" with walls, requiring precise obstacle avoidance.
4.  **Ramp Ascent and Descent:** Successfully traversing a 20-degree ramp, both uphill and downhill, demonstrating robust locomotion control.
5.  **Confined Passage Navigation:** Guiding the robot through narrow passages between walls, demanding accurate steering.
   

Our performance in these tasks, particularly our robot's ability to seamlessly transition between different environments and execute complex multi-step processes, is what propelled us to the top.
